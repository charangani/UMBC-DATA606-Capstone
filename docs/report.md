<h2><b>BACKGROUND</b></h2><br>
The dataset is about predicting customer churn in the banking sector. It contains various features like credit score, age, tenure, balance, number of products, credit card status, active membership status, estimated salary, and churn status1. Predicting customer churn is critical for businesses, especially in the banking sector. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, banks can proactively address their concerns and improve customer retention1.
Research Questions : <br>
“Can we predict if a customer will churn based on their profile information?” This can be broken down into several sub-questions, such as:<br>
“What factors are most influential in predicting customer churn?”<br>
“How does age affect the likelihood of churn?”<br>
“Does having a credit card make a customer more or less likely to churn?”<br>
“How does the number of products a customer uses affect their likelihood of churn?”<br>
